Footer Injection for MyBB
Inject code into forum footer
Author: jimmypena
Submitted: 25th January 2013**

This plugin allows you to insert code in the footer of every page of your forum. For example, you may want to display a message or advertisement at the bottom of each page. Instead of having to manually edit the theme (and remember to do it each time you change or update themes), this plugin inserts the code regardless of what theme you are using. No PHP or MyBB template codes.
